# Rick and Morty app

I wanted to use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to fetch some data so, why not?

This project uses [React Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-apollo/) and the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#graphql). It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
